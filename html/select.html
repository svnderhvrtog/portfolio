                        <h2>Research</h2>
                        <p>
                            The project began with a broad target group: creative professionals. I narrowed this down to audio-visual specialists. This decision was based on desk research, where I discovered many similarities between the two groups. Both need to take initiative and possess the ability to create new things.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This led to the question: How can we support the creative process of an audio-visual specialist?
                            <br><br>
                            To answer that, I conducted several interviews with specialists from the field, including an editor, camera operator, and narrator. What stood out most was the lack of communication and understanding from clients, a common issue before, during, and after production.

                        <p>
                            Based on the identified issues, I’ve executed multiple creative sessions. The focus laid primarily on the subject ‘feedback’, which was hard to make practicable for both parties.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The sessions led to the development of a tool that generates feedback quickly. This tool aims to serve as a bridge between both parties, hopefully alleviating some of the challenges on both sides. One of the biggest challenges with this solution is that not every client may be willing to invest the effort to use such a platform (according to the target group).

                        <p>
                            The concept developed is called Select. It is a tool designed to increase engagement from stakeholders by involving them more in the editing and distribution process. With improved engagement, stakeholders are more likely to feel empathetic and supportive.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            During the first iteration, a low-fidelity prototype was developed to give participants an impression of what the concept would look like. This allowed us to test whether the setup was desirable for all parties involved.

                        <p>The second iteration came to life with an aesthetically pleasing color scheme and various components. It also introduced the ability to provide feedback, and several projects were enhanced to give a clearer understanding of the application yet to be developed. Other additions included role-based access and teams, as well as a quick tour after signing up.</p>

                            The final week was dedicated to minor fixes, such as bug fixes, refining the sign-up flow, and adding notifications.

                            The product aligns well with the target group and client (WeTransfer), with minimal defects or flaws observed. The web application facilitates feedback between creatives and stakeholders, easing the workload for creatives while fostering greater empathy from stakeholders. Throughout the project, the application evolved towards a more co-creative approach, ultimately making the product usable across multiple creative disciplines such as videography, photography, and design.
