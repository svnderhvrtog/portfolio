                        <h2>Research</h2>
                        <p>I started this project with a research phase, during which the target group was narrowed down to office workers. Based on the data, it became clear that:</p>
                        <ul>    
                            <li>&#8226; Employees often don’t feel heard or taken seriously because they don’t see changes despite giving feedback.</li>
                            <li>&#8226; Employees feel overwhelmed by the fast pace of development.</li>
                            <li>&#8226; Employees resist process changes due to insecurities, such as potential financial instability and job insecurity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The idea to develop a system focused on care emerged from these insights. Given that change in work environments is inevitable, the decision was made to prioritize the well-being of employees and improve their experience during the "resistance phase".</p>

                        <p>During the first iteration, the focus was on building a solid and logical structure. I achieved this by creating a flowchart that shaped the overall flow of the prototype I was developing. The flowchart served as the foundation for the prototype, while I simultaneously built a low-key design system. This design system was based on simplicity and robotic elements, aiming to create an overall friendly, calm, and welcoming approach. I achieved this through inviting forms and neutral colors.</p>

                        <p>The CareBot is primarily a system designed for interaction, starting with text-based communication and simple questions. I chose this form of communication to ensure usability for all (digital) skill levels. The system assists the user based on data input and prompt-driven machine learning. Although the development of this system was primarily focused on desktop use, it is also scalable to smaller screens, such as tablets and smartphones.</p>

                            The final phase was dedicated to minor fixes, such as bug fixes and further development of the prewritten questions and answers, as well as preparing an in-depth presentation for stakeholders.

                            The product aligns with the given assignment. It supports employees by providing a space to vent, offering practical tips and exercises to enhance their employee experience. Whether the CareBot will be effective in the long term remains to be seen. Nonetheless, this is one of many steps toward better psychological health care in the workplace.
